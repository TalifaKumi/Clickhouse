Code: 305. DB::Exception: Received from dnieto-zenbook.lan:9440. DB::Exception: We can't drop local replica, please use `DROP TABLE` if you want to clean the data and drop this replica. (TABLE_WAS_NOT_DROPPED)
After DROP REPLICA, we need to check that the replica is gone from the list or replicas:
SELECT DISTINCT arrayJoin(mapKeys(replica_is_active)) AS replica_name
FROM system.replicas
